---------- Research Guideline in my group (for future and current students)------------


## 1. Use of Generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini)
	- Generated content must be carefully verified for originality. AI-generated content must not replace original research contributions or critical thinking. If AI-assisted content is used, it must be reviewed or disclosed per the venueâ€™s policy (conferences/journals).

	- Do not copy-paste AI outputs without review or modification. You are fully responsible for the accuracy and integrity of anything submitted under your name and our group.


## 2. Paper Submissions and Approval Process
	- Supervisor Approval: No paper should be submitted without prior approval from the supervisor(s), including the final draft. Early planning and sharing of timelines are encouraged. Inform the supervisor at least two weeks before the intended submission deadline.

	- Internal Review: All papers should undergo internal review within the group/co-authors before submission. The first author needs to proactively reach out to them and this includes allowing sufficient time for feedback and revisions.


## 3. Co-authorship and Contribution
	- Discuss authorship and roles early in the project and revisit as needed. 

	- Fair Attribution: Co-authors must have made an intellectual contribution to the work (e.g., idea formulation, technical design, analysis, in-depth discussion, implementation, writing and editing).


## 4. Dual Publishing
	- No Dual Submissions: Submitting the same content to multiple venues simultaneously is strictly prohibited.

	- Extension of Previous Work: If submitting an extension of previously published work (e.g., from a workshop or a conference), clearly disclose the relationship and cite the earlier publication and discuss the major differences.

	- ArXiv Posting: Preprints may be uploaded to arXiv only after discussion with and approval from the supervisor. Be mindful of venue-specific policies on preprints.


## 5. Reproducibility: 

	- All research code, frameworks, and tools developed should be well-documented, version-controlled (e.g., via Git), and structured to support reproducibility.

	- Frameworks developed using group resources or as part of a group project are considered group or university assets, not private codebases. 

	- You are strongly encouraged in developing high-quality implementation for your own framework rather than direct minor modifications of others' frameworks to conduct your core implementations.


## 6. External communication and Accountability for the group

	- You are accountable for the integrity, originality, and quality of your research outputs. When in doubt, please ask before acting.

	- Please be respectful and objective in all group and external research interactions.
